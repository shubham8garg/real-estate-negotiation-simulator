## Exercise 1: MCP vs A2A vs Direct API

### Answers

**a) Which integrations use MCP?**
- **Yahoo Finance stock prices** → MCP
  - External data source → perfect MCP use case
  - Multiple agents might need price data
  - Would create a `stock-pricing` MCP server with tools like `get_current_price(ticker)`, `get_historical_prices(ticker, days)`

- **Internal portfolio database** → MCP or Direct API
  - If only one agent uses it → direct function call
  - If multiple agents need portfolio data → MCP server with `get_holdings()`, `update_position()`, `get_performance()` tools

**b) Which use A2A?**
- **Risk assessment agent** → A2A
  - Another autonomous agent with its own goals/logic
  - Needs to reason about the trade and respond with approval/rejection/conditions
  - Uses structured messages: `TradeProposal`, `RiskAssessment`, `Approval`

- **News analysis agent** → A2A
  - Another agent that autonomously processes news and forms sentiment opinions
  - Returns `SentimentReport` via A2A message

**c) Direct function call?**
- Simple utility functions with no AI reasoning (e.g., `calculate_tax()`, `format_currency()`)

**d) Architecture diagram**:
```
Trading Agent
    │
    ├── MCP → Yahoo Finance MCP Server → get_stock_price("AAPL")
    │
    ├── MCP → Portfolio DB MCP Server → get_holdings(), update_position()
    │
    ├── A2A → Risk Assessment Agent → TradeProposal → RiskReport
    │                (another LLM agent)
    │
    └── A2A → News Analysis Agent → SentimentRequest → SentimentReport
                  (another LLM agent)
```

## Exercise 2: LangGraph State Design

### Answers

**a) Why `Annotated[list, operator.add]`?**
```python
# Without Annotated (WRONG for accumulation):
class State(TypedDict):
    history: list[dict]

# If buyer_node returns: {"history": [{"round": 1, "offer": 425000}]}
# And seller_node returns: {"history": [{"round": 1, "counter": 477000}]}
# LangGraph applies updates sequentially: history = [{"round": 1, "counter": 477000}]
# ← buyer's entry is LOST! Last writer wins.

# With Annotated (CORRECT):
class State(TypedDict):
    history: Annotated[list[dict], operator.add]

# buyer_node returns: {"history": [{"round": 1, "offer": 425000}]}
# seller_node returns: {"history": [{"round": 1, "counter": 477000}]}
# LangGraph CONCATENATES: history = [
#     {"round": 1, "offer": 425000},    ← kept
#     {"round": 1, "counter": 477000}   ← appended
# ]
```

**b) Why separate price fields instead of just the last A2A message?**
- Direct field access is faster (no parsing required)
- Router functions need quick access: `state["buyer_current_offer"]` vs parsing JSON
- State should be normalized: prices are fundamentally floats, not embedded in message dicts
- The A2A message is stored too (in `last_buyer_message`) for full context when needed

**c) Advantages of `Literal` type for status:**
```python
# String (what we use for simplicity):
status: str  # Could accidentally be "AGREED" or "agreeed" (typo)

# Literal (better for production):
from typing import Literal
NegotiationStatus = Literal["negotiating", "agreed", "deadlocked", "buyer_walked", "seller_rejected", "error"]
status: NegotiationStatus

# Benefits:
# 1. Type checker catches invalid values at write time
# 2. IDE autocomplete shows valid values
# 3. Explicit enumeration of all possible states
# 4. Router functions can be exhaustively checked
```

**d) New fields for mediator agent:**
```python
class NegotiationState(TypedDict):
    # ... existing fields ...

    # Mediator tracking
    mediator_active: bool           # Is mediator currently intervening?
    mediator_proposal: Optional[float]  # Mediator's proposed price
    buyer_mediator_vote: Optional[str]  # "accept" | "reject" | None
    seller_mediator_vote: Optional[str] # "accept" | "reject" | None
    mediator_reasoning: Optional[str]   # Why mediator proposed this price
```

## Exercise 3: Information Asymmetry

### Answers

**a) Two technical approaches for access control:**

**Approach 1: API Key per Agent**
```python
# inventory_server.py
import os

SELLER_API_KEY = os.environ.get("SELLER_MCP_KEY", "secret-seller-key")

@mcp.tool()
def get_minimum_acceptable_price(property_id: str) -> dict:
    """Get seller's floor price. REQUIRES seller API key."""
    # In FastMCP, you'd check request headers or initialize params
    # This is a simplified illustration
    if not _check_caller_is_seller():
        raise McpError(ErrorCode.Unauthorized, "This tool requires seller credentials")
    ...

# Buyer connects without seller key → tool raises Unauthorized
# Seller connects with seller key → tool works
```

**Approach 2: Separate MCP Servers**
```python
# Public server (both agents)
# inventory_server_public.py — only exposes get_inventory_level()

# Private server (seller only)
# inventory_server_seller.py — exposes get_minimum_acceptable_price()
#                              only runs for seller agent

# Buyer agent connects to:
#   pricing_server.py + inventory_server_public.py

# Seller agent connects to:
#   pricing_server.py + inventory_server_seller.py (private)
```

**b) Effect if buyer could access floor price:**
- Negotiation would be very short: buyer would offer $445,001 immediately
- No longer realistic (real buyers don't know seller's bottom line)
- Not ethical in actual real estate (information fiduciary duty)
- However, it COULD model insider trading or collusion scenarios

**c) Modeling information advantages:**
```python
# Add a "motivation_signal" to inventory server that's partially accurate
@mcp.tool()
def get_seller_urgency_signal(property_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Returns indirect signals about seller motivation.
    (Public information — what a buyer's agent could discover through research)

    NOT the actual floor price, but observable signals:
    - How many times has price been reduced?
    - How many days on market vs. neighborhood average?
    - Is property vacant? (suggests urgency)
    - Public records: seller bought new home? (suggests urgency)
    """
    return {
        "price_reductions": 0,
        "days_on_market_vs_avg": "+3 days",  # slightly above average
        "property_vacant": False,
        "seller_purchased_new_home": True,   # public record — suggests urgency!
        "signal_strength": "moderate",
        "interpretation": "Seller may be moderately motivated due to having purchased new home"
    }
```

## Exercise 5: Anchoring Strategy — Solution

### Modified `SELLER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `seller_simple.py`:

```python
SELLER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are an expert real estate listing agent with deep knowledge
of negotiation psychology, specifically the ANCHORING technique.

Property: {PROPERTY_ADDRESS}
Listed at: ${LISTING_PRICE:,}

ANCHORING STRATEGY:
The anchoring effect in negotiation: by starting with a very high number,
you make subsequent concessions feel more generous, and you shift the
buyer's reference point upward.

YOUR ANCHORING APPROACH:
  Round 1: Counter at $495,000 (ABOVE listing — justified by $75K in upgrades)
           Frame this confidently: "The improvements alone add $75K in value"
  Round 2: "Come down" to $482,000 — looks like big concession from $495K
  Round 3: $470,000 — still looks reasonable from the $495K anchor
  Round 4: $458,000 — now buyer feels they've negotiated hard
  Round 5 (if needed): $449,000 — your "absolute final"

PSYCHOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR OPENING AT $495K:
  • Kitchen renovation (2023): $45,000 — comparable homes without this sell for less
  • New roof (2022): $18,000 — buyers save on this for 25+ years
  • HVAC (2021): $12,000
  • Total upgrades: $75,000+
  • Market momentum: Austin market appreciating 4% annually
  Therefore: $485,000 list + $10,000 premium for quality = $495,000

ABSOLUTE FLOOR: ${MINIMUM_PRICE:,} (mortgage payoff — cannot go lower)
...
"""
```

**Expected outcome analysis:**
- Anchoring at $495K typically shifts the midpoint upward by $3-7K
- If buyer was going to settle at $449K without anchoring → may settle at $452-456K with anchoring
- Depends heavily on buyer agent's LLM and how strongly it "holds" to market data as counter-anchor

## Exercise 6: Deadlock Detection Tool — Solution

```python
@mcp.tool()
def check_negotiation_deadlock(
    buyer_offer: float,

## Exercise 7: SSE Client — Solution

```python
# In buyer_simple.py — SSE transport option

import os
from mcp.client.sse import sse_client  # SSE client

    """
    if MCP_TRANSPORT == "sse":
        return await _call_pricing_mcp_sse(tool_name, arguments)
    else:
        return await _call_pricing_mcp_stdio(tool_name, arguments)


async def _call_pricing_mcp_sse(tool_name: str, arguments: dict) -> dict:
    """SSE transport — connect to HTTP server."""
    async with sse_client(MCP_SSE_URL) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            result = await session.call_tool(tool_name, arguments)
            if result.content:
                return json.loads(result.content[0].text)

async def _call_pricing_mcp_stdio(tool_name: str, arguments: dict) -> dict:
    """stdio transport — spawn server as subprocess."""
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command=sys.executable,
        args=[PRICING_SERVER_PATH],
    )
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:

                return json.loads(result.content[0].text)

**Key differences between stdio and SSE:**

| | stdio | SSE |
|---|---|---|
| Server lifetime | Lives for duration of client connection | Runs independently |
| Multiple clients | One server per client | Many clients, one server |
| Startup time | Spawns new process each connection | Server already running |
| Network | Local only (subprocess pipes) | Can be remote |
| Best for | Development, local tools | Production, shared tools |

### Discussion Answers

**a) When is `Annotated[list[dict], operator.add]` essential vs. optional?**

In a DAG graph (no cycles, no fan-out), the reducer doesn't actively prevent data
loss because no two branches are updating the same field simultaneously.
However it DOES matter for accumulation: without `operator.add`, each node's
`{"history": [...]}` return overwrites the previous list instead of appending.
The reducer is ESSENTIAL whenever multiple nodes write to the same list field,
or when you need an accumulated log across the run. Without it, only the last
writer's entries survive.

**b) Defensive `route_after_triage` for unexpected values:**
```python
def route_after_triage(state: SupportState) -> str:
    raw = state.get("classification", "").strip().lower()
    # Normalize: payment -> billing, crash -> technical, etc.
    billing_aliases = {"billing", "payment", "invoice", "refund", "charge", "subscription"}
    technical_aliases = {"technical", "tech", "bug", "error", "crash", "system"}
    if raw in billing_aliases:
        return "billing"
    if raw in technical_aliases:
        return "technical"
    return "general"  # safe fallback
```

**c) Cyclic (negotiation) vs. DAG (support triage) implications:**

| | Negotiation (cyclic) | Support Triage (DAG) |
|--|--|--|
| Infinite loop risk | YES — must have max_rounds | No — graph terminates by structure |
| Termination condition | Required (FSM, round counter) | Built into graph (no back-edges to START) |
| Router complexity | Must check state + round number | Simple: read one field |
| State accumulation | Critical — history grows across loops | Optional — single pass |

### Discussion Answers

**a) Explicit vs. implicit routing — when to use each:**

| | Explicit (LangGraph router function) | Implicit (ADK LLM routing) |
|--|--|--|
| Correctness guarantee | Deterministic — always routes correctly | LLM can make classification errors |
| Auditability | Route decision visible in code | Embedded in LLM reasoning |
| New categories | Add one branch to router + one node | Update prompt + add sub_agent |
| Cost | No extra LLM call for routing | Routing is part of orchestrator LLM call |
| Best for | Precise, rule-based routing | Natural language classification with fuzzy boundaries |

Choose explicit routing when correctness is critical and categories are well-defined.
Choose implicit routing when the categories are nuanced and benefit from LLM understanding.

**b) How the orchestrator "remembers" its classification in ADK:**

ADK maintains a **conversation thread** within the session. When the orchestrator
runs, its reasoning and classification appear in the session's event history.
When a sub-agent is invoked via `agent_transfer`, the context of the conversation
so far (including what the orchestrator decided) is passed along in the session
state. There is no explicit Python variable holding `classification` — it lives
in the session's conversation history as the orchestrator's internal reasoning.

**c) Adding a 4th specialist (returns_node):**

LangGraph changes:
1. Create `returns_node` async function
2. `workflow.add_node("returns", returns_node)`
3. `workflow.add_edge("returns", "format_response")`
4. Add `"returns": "returns"` to `add_conditional_edges` dict
5. Update `route_after_triage` to return `"returns"` for returns tickets
6. Update `triage_node` system prompt to include "returns" as a category

ADK changes:
1. Create `returns_agent = LlmAgent(...)`
2. Add to `sub_agents=[..., returns_agent]`
3. Update orchestrator instruction to mention returns_agent and when to use it

Verdict: ADK requires fewer structural code changes (2 changes vs. 6).
LangGraph gives you explicit control of exactly when `returns` is chosen.

**d) Making ADK version production-ready — three specific changes:**

1. **Persistent sessions**: Replace `InMemorySessionService` with a database-backed
   session service (e.g., `VertexAiSessionService` or a custom Redis/PostgreSQL
   implementation). This survives server restarts.

2. **Structured logging and tracing**: Capture all ADK events (not just final response)
   and log `event.author`, `event.content`, and timestamps to a centralized log store.
   Add correlation IDs linking each ticket to its full event trace.

3. **Error handling and fallback**: Wrap `runner.run_async()` in try/except.
   If the orchestrator fails to route (no `is_final_response` event within a timeout),
   fall back to a default general response rather than returning an empty string.
