# Module 3 — LangGraph Multi-Agent Workflow (`m3_langgraph_multiagents`)

**Requires:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`

This is the first version of the negotiation that actually *works end-to-end*: real LLM agents, real MCP data, real negotiation logic, all connected by a LangGraph workflow.

---

## What this module teaches

In Module 1 we had a `while True` loop with no structure. In Module 2 we had MCP tools but no agents to use them.

Module 3 brings it all together:

| What | How |
|---|---|
| Structured turn-taking | LangGraph `StateGraph` — not a manual loop |
| Typed messages between agents | `TypedDict` with explicit `price`, `message_type`, `conditions` fields |
| Real market data for every offer | MCP calls to `pricing_server.py` and `inventory_server.py` |
| Termination guarantee | Conditional edges route to `END` when a deal is reached or rounds run out |
| Observability | Full message history in LangGraph state — you can see every round |

---

## File breakdown

### `negotiation_types.py` — The message contract

Before any agents run, this file defines what a negotiation message *is*. Both the buyer and seller speak this format.

```python
NegotiationMessage = TypedDict("NegotiationMessage", {
    "message_type": str,      # "offer", "counter_offer", "acceptance", "withdrawal"
    "price": float,           # always a number, never a string
    "message": str,           # human-readable explanation
    "conditions": list,       # e.g. ["45-day close", "inspection contingency"]
    "closing_timeline_days": int,
})
```

This is what fixes failure modes #1, #2, and #5 from Module 1: no more raw strings, no more regex on free-form text. Every message has a price field — no ambiguity about which number is the offer.

**Factory functions** make it easy to create valid messages:

```python
create_offer(session_id, round_num, price, message, conditions)
create_counter_offer(...)
create_acceptance(...)
create_withdrawal(...)
```

### `buyer_simple.py` — Buyer agent (GPT-4o)

The buyer's job: start below asking price and negotiate up only as far as necessary, staying under budget ($460,000).

**How it works each round:**
1. GPT-4o acts as a planner — decides which MCP tools to call this turn
2. Calls `get_market_price` and/or `calculate_discount` from `pricing_server.py`
3. GPT-4o uses that data to decide on a price and write a justification
4. Returns a `NegotiationMessage` dict for LangGraph state

The buyer never connects to `inventory_server.py` — it doesn't know the seller's floor price.

### `seller_simple.py` — Seller agent (GPT-4o)

The seller's job: start at asking price and come down only as far as their minimum ($445,000).

**How it differs from the buyer:**
- Connects to **both** `pricing_server.py` and `inventory_server.py`
- Uses `get_minimum_acceptable_price` to set a hard floor — any offer above it gets accepted immediately without calling GPT-4o
- The floor enforcement is hardcoded: the LLM cannot override it

This is the information asymmetry from Module 2 in action: the seller knows their floor; the buyer has to figure it out through negotiation.

### `langgraph_flow.py` — The negotiation graph

This is where LangGraph comes in. Instead of a `while True` loop, the negotiation is a **directed graph**:

```
START
  |
  v
init (set up state)
  |
  v
buyer_node (buyer takes a turn)
  |
  +-- offer was accepted or withdrawn? --> END
  |
  v
seller_node (seller responds)
  |
  +-- seller accepted or max rounds? --> END
  |
  v
buyer_node (loop back)
```

**The LangGraph state:**

```python
class NegotiationState(TypedDict):
    history: Annotated[list[dict], operator.add]   # all messages, auto-appended
    status: str                                     # "negotiating", "agreed", "failed"
    agreed_price: float
    current_round: int
    max_rounds: int
```

The `Annotated[list, operator.add]` reducer means each node just returns new messages — LangGraph automatically appends them to history. No node needs to read the old list and write a new one.

**Conditional edges** replace the `if/elif` chain you'd write manually:

```python
graph.add_conditional_edges("buyer", route_after_buyer, {
    "to_seller": "seller",
    "end": END,
})
```

## How to run

Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Demo mode (code walkthroughs) only runs with `--demo`.

```bash
# With full code walkthrough + live negotiation (step-by-step pauses)
python m3_langgraph_multiagents/main_langgraph_multiagent.py --demo

# With walkthrough, no pauses
python m3_langgraph_multiagents/main_langgraph_multiagent.py --demo --fast

# Skip code walkthroughs, just run the negotiation
python m3_langgraph_multiagents/main_langgraph_multiagent.py

# Adjust number of rounds
python m3_langgraph_multiagents/main_langgraph_multiagent.py --rounds 3
python m3_langgraph_multiagents/main_langgraph_multiagent.py --demo --rounds 8
```

**What `--demo` shows (Parts 0–4):**
- Part 0: FSM → LangGraph bridge — what changed and why
- Part 1: `NegotiationMessage` and `NegotiationState` TypedDict source
- Part 2: `BuyerAgent` source — `__init__`, MCP planner, offer logic
- Part 3: `SellerAgent` source — dual MCP connections, floor guardrail
- Part 4: LangGraph graph wiring — `StateGraph`, nodes, conditional edges

**What to expect during negotiation:**
- Both agents connect to MCP servers automatically (no manual setup needed)
- Each round is printed with a visual turn box: type, price, message
- Final result: AGREED at some price, DEADLOCKED if max rounds hit, or BUYER WALKED AWAY
- The buyer stays under $460K (budget); the seller holds above $445K (floor)

## Exercises

| Exercise | Difficulty | Task |
|---|---|---|
| `ex01_trace_graph_flow.md` | `[Core]` | Add a deadlock-breaker conditional edge that detects stale prices and ends early |
| `ex02_run_two_rounds.md` | `[Core]` | Add automatic convergence accept — if offers are within 2%, agree at midpoint |
| `ex03_stretch_state_persistence.md` | `[Stretch]` | Add SQLite-based state persistence so negotiations can be paused and resumed |
| `ex04_capstone_inspector_agent.md` | `[Stretch]` | **Capstone**: Add an inspector agent with a new MCP server and LangGraph node — ties all modules together |

Solutions are in `m3_langgraph_multiagents/solution/`. Each exercise includes a reflection question.

## Quick mental model
- If you want to see buyer/seller decision logic, open `buyer_simple.py` or `seller_simple.py`.
- If you want to see how the turn loop works, open `langgraph_flow.py` and look at the graph edges.
- The MCP servers (`m2_mcp/pricing_server.py` + `m2_mcp/inventory_server.py`) are started automatically — you don't need to run them separately.
