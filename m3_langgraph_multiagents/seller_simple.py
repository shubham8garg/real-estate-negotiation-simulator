"""
Seller Agent — Simple Python Version
========================================
A real estate seller agent implemented using OpenAI GPT-4o and MCP tools.

ARCHITECTURE:
  Mirror of buyer_simple.py but with opposing goals and different MCP tools.

  KEY DIFFERENCE FROM BUYER:
  The seller agent connects to BOTH MCP servers:
  - pricing_server: to understand market value and buyer's perspective
  - inventory_server: to know its floor price and market pressure

  This demonstrates MCP's access control concept:
  - Seller has access to get_minimum_acceptable_price()
  - Buyer does NOT (it connects to a different set of tools)

STRATEGY:
  - Starts at $477,000 (lists at $485,000 but expects negotiation)
  - Highlights renovation value (kitchen $45K, roof $18K, HVAC $12K)
  - Drops in small increments: $477K → $469K → $462K → $456K → $449K
  - Never goes below $445,000 (mortgage payoff requirement)
  - Accepts any offer at or above $445,000

SELLER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are an expert real estate listing agent representing the sellers of:

Property: {PROPERTY_ADDRESS}
Type: Single Family Home, 4 BR / 3 BA, 2,400 sqft, built 2005
Listed at: ${LISTING_PRICE:,}

PROPERTY HIGHLIGHTS (use these to justify your price):
  • Kitchen fully renovated in 2023 — $45,000 upgrade (quartz counters, new appliances)
  • New roof installed 2022 — $18,000 (30-year architectural shingles)
  • HVAC system replaced 2021 — $12,000 (Carrier 16 SEER)
  • Total recent upgrades: $75,000+
  • School district: Austin ISD — rated 8/10
  • No HOA fees

YOUR SELLER'S PROFILE:
  - Minimum acceptable price: ${MINIMUM_PRICE:,} (CANNOT go below — mortgage payoff)
  - Ideal closing price: ${IDEAL_PRICE:,}
  - Must close by: March 31, 2025 (seller has purchased another home)
  - Willing to include all appliances
  - Flexible on closing date (30–60 days)

YOUR STRATEGY:
  - Round 1: Counter at $477,000 (hold strong, highlight renovations)
  - Each round: Drop by $5,000–$8,000 only
  - Always reference the $75K in upgrades as added value
  - Use inventory/market data to show seller's market advantage
  - If buyer reaches ${MINIMUM_PRICE:,} or above, ACCEPT immediately

YOUR RESPONSE FORMAT (strict JSON):
{{
    "counter_price": <integer — your counter-offer price>,
    "message": "<professional message to buyer, referencing property value>",
    "reasoning": "<internal notes — your strategy and observations>",
    "accept": <true if you're accepting the buyer's offer, false otherwise>,
    "reject": <true if you're terminating negotiations, false otherwise>
}}

CRITICAL RULES:
  - NEVER counter below ${MINIMUM_PRICE:,} — this is your mortgage payoff minimum
  - If buyer offers ${MINIMUM_PRICE:,} or more, set accept: true immediately
  - Emphasize the $75,000 in recent renovations in EVERY response
  - Be firm but professional — don't be insulted by low offers"""

class SellerAgent:
    """
    Real estate seller agent powered by OpenAI GPT-4o.

    KEY DIFFERENCES FROM BUYER AGENT:
    1. Connects to BOTH pricing and inventory MCP servers
    2. Has access to get_minimum_acceptable_price() (buyer does not)
    3. Strategy is to hold firm and drop slowly
    4. Accepts any offer >= minimum price

    INFORMATION ASYMMETRY TEACHING POINT:
    The seller knows its floor price from the inventory server.
    The buyer is trying to guess it from market data.
    This mirrors real-world real estate negotiations perfectly.
