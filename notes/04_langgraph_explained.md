## 1. Why Orchestration Is Needed

### The Problem with Raw Agent Loops

When you build multi-agent systems, you quickly run into problems that raw Python loops can't solve cleanly:

```python
# The naive approach — what everyone tries first
async def run_negotiation():
    round = 0
    buyer_offer = 425000
    seller_counter = None

    while round < 5:
        # Call buyer LLM
        buyer_response = await call_openai(buyer_prompt)
        # Parse the response (what if it's malformed?)
        # What if the LLM says "I walk away" but doesn't set a flag?
        # How do we handle the state across rounds?
        # What if we need to pause and resume?
        # What if we need to add a mediator agent?
        # What if step 3 depends on a condition at step 1?

        seller_response = await call_openai(seller_prompt)
        round += 1

    # This doesn't scale. This becomes spaghetti code.
```

**Problems this code has**:
1. **No structured state** — variables scattered everywhere
2. **No clear routing** — what happens if buyer walks away in round 2?
3. **No persistence** — if the process crashes, you lose everything
4. **No observability** — hard to debug what happened in which step
5. **No extensibility** — adding a mediator agent means rewriting the loop
6. **No parallelism** — can't run buyer research and seller research concurrently

LangGraph solves all of these by modeling your agent workflow as a **directed graph**.

## 2. What LangGraph Is

LangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain that lets you build **stateful, cyclical multi-agent workflows** as graphs.

### Key Properties

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Built by** | LangChain team |
| **Underlying model** | Directed graph (nodes + edges) with shared state |
| **Supports cycles** | Yes (unlike DAGs) — enables agent loops |
| **State management** | Typed state with reducers |
| **Persistence** | Built-in checkpointing via checkpointers |
| **Streaming** | Stream tokens and events in real-time |
| **Human-in-loop** | Interrupt and resume at any node |
| **Multi-agent** | First-class support for multiple agents |

### The Mental Model

```
LangGraph Workflow = State Machine

State Machine Components:
  • States   → The shared data all nodes can read/write (NegotiationState)
  • Nodes    → The agents/functions that transform state (buyer_node, seller_node)
  • Edges    → The transitions between nodes (buyer → seller → check → buyer)
  • Guards   → Conditions that determine which edge to take (is_agreement_reached?)
```

Compare to a traffic system:
- **State** = current traffic conditions (speeds, queue lengths)
- **Nodes** = traffic lights (they take action)
- **Edges** = roads between intersections
- **Guards** = traffic sensors (determine which light turns green)

---

## 3. Core Concepts: State, Nodes, Edges

### State — The Shared Memory

State is the single source of truth that all nodes can read from and write to.

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Optional, Annotated
import operator

class NegotiationState(TypedDict):
    """
    The shared state for the entire negotiation workflow.
    Every node reads from this and returns updates to it.

    TypedDict is used instead of a class because LangGraph needs
    to understand the structure for serialization/checkpointing.
    """

    # Property being negotiated
    property_address: str
    listing_price: float

    # Agent constraints (immutable)
    buyer_budget: float
    seller_minimum: float

    # Current negotiation positions
    buyer_current_offer: float
    seller_current_counter: float

    # Progress tracking
    round_number: int
    max_rounds: int
    status: str  # "negotiating" | "agreed" | "deadlocked" | "buyer_walked"

    # Result
    agreed_price: Optional[float]

    # Conversation history (uses reducer to append, not overwrite)
    history: Annotated[list[dict], operator.add]

    # LLM conversation context (kept separate per agent)
    buyer_context: list[dict]   # OpenAI messages format for buyer LLM
    seller_context: list[dict]  # OpenAI messages format for seller LLM
```

#### Annotated Reducers

Notice `history: Annotated[list[dict], operator.add]`. This is a **reducer** — it tells LangGraph how to merge state updates from nodes.

```python
# WITHOUT reducer (default: last-write-wins)
history = []
node_1_update = {"history": ["msg_1"]}  # node 1 returns this
node_2_update = {"history": ["msg_2"]}  # node 2 returns this
# Result: history = ["msg_2"]  ← msg_1 was LOST!

# WITH reducer (operator.add = list concatenation)
history: Annotated[list, operator.add] = []
node_1_update = {"history": ["msg_1"]}
node_2_update = {"history": ["msg_2"]}
# Result: history = ["msg_1", "msg_2"]  ← both preserved!
```

### Nodes — The Processing Units

Nodes are **Python functions** (sync or async) that take the current state and return a partial update.

```python
async def buyer_node(state: NegotiationState) -> dict:
    """
    The buyer agent node.

    Contract:
    - INPUT: full NegotiationState
    - OUTPUT: dict with ONLY the fields this node changes
    - MUST NOT: mutate state directly
    - MUST: return a dictionary (partial state update)
    """
    # Read from state
    round_num = state["round_number"]
    seller_counter = state["seller_current_counter"]
    buyer_context = state["buyer_context"]

    # Do the agent's work
    new_offer, new_context, message = await call_buyer_llm(
        round_num=round_num,
        seller_counter=seller_counter,
        context=buyer_context,
        budget=state["buyer_budget"]
    )

    # Return ONLY what changed
    return {
        "buyer_current_offer": new_offer,
        "buyer_context": new_context,
        "round_number": round_num + 1,
        "history": [{"round": round_num, "from": "buyer", "offer": new_offer, "message": message}]
        #            ↑ This APPENDS to history (because of the reducer)
    }
```

**Critical rule**: Nodes return a **dictionary of updates**, not the full state. LangGraph merges this into the existing state automatically.

### Node Types Taxonomy

> From [LangGraph — Thinking in LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/thinking-in-langgraph):
> *"Start by identifying the distinct steps in your process. Each step will become a node."*

Not all nodes are LLM calls. The docs identify four node types:

| Type | Purpose | Example in our workshop |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM step** | Understanding, reasoning, decisions | `buyer_node` — GPT-4o decides the offer price |
| **Data step** | Fetch external information | MCP tool call inside `call_pricing_mcp()` |
| **Action step** | External operations with side effects | Sending an A2A message |
| **User input step** | Human review / approval point | `interrupt()` for human-in-the-loop |

Finer-grained nodes (one type per node) provide:
- More frequent checkpoints — less re-execution on failure
- Isolated retry policies — can retry just the data step, not the LLM step
- Better observability — you can inspect state between every step
- Easier testing — each node is a pure function you can unit-test

In our workshop, `buyer_node` combines LLM + data + action into one node for simplicity. In production, you'd split these apart.

### Edges — The Connections

Edges define which node runs after the current one.

```python
# Simple edge — always goes to seller after buyer
workflow.add_edge("buyer", "seller")

# Conditional edge — the next node depends on state
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "seller",               # source node
    route_after_seller,     # function that decides next node
    {
        "continue": "buyer",      # if route returns "continue"
        "agreed": END,            # if route returns "agreed"
        "deadlocked": END,        # if route returns "deadlocked"
        "buyer_walked": END,      # if route returns "buyer_walked"
    }
)
```

---

## 4. Building Your First Graph

Here's the complete pattern for building a LangGraph workflow:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict

# Step 1: Define State
class SimpleState(TypedDict):
    count: int
    messages: list[str]

# Step 2: Define Nodes
def increment_node(state: SimpleState) -> dict:
    """Simple counter node."""
    return {
        "count": state["count"] + 1,
        "messages": [f"Count is now {state['count'] + 1}"]
    }

def check_node(state: SimpleState) -> dict:
    """Evaluation node — doesn't change state, just reads."""
    print(f"Current count: {state['count']}")
    return {}  # no state change

# Step 3: Define Router
def should_continue(state: SimpleState) -> str:
    """Decides next step based on state."""
    if state["count"] >= 5:
        return "done"
    return "continue"

# Step 4: Build the Graph
workflow = StateGraph(SimpleState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("increment", increment_node)
workflow.add_node("check", check_node)

# Set entry point
workflow.set_entry_point("increment")

# Add edges
workflow.add_edge("increment", "check")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "check",
    should_continue,
    {
        "continue": "increment",  # loop back
        "done": END               # terminate
    }
)

# Step 5: Compile the graph
graph = workflow.compile()

# Step 6: Run it
final_state = graph.invoke({"count": 0, "messages": []})
print(final_state)
# Output: {"count": 5, "messages": ["Count is now 1", ..., "Count is now 5"]}
```

### Visualizing the Graph

```python
# LangGraph can generate visual representations
print(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid())
```

Output:
```
flowchart TD
    __start__ --> increment
    increment --> check
    check -->|continue| increment
    check -->|done| __end__
```

Which renders as:
```
START
  │
  ▼
INCREMENT ◄──────────┐
  │                  │
  ▼                  │
CHECK ── continue ───┘
  │
  └── done ──► END
```

---

## 5. Conditional Routing

Conditional routing is what makes LangGraph powerful — it allows the workflow to branch based on the current state.

### Router Function Pattern

```python
def route_after_seller(state: NegotiationState) -> str:
    """
    Router function — called after seller node runs.
    Returns a string key that maps to the next node.

    This function ONLY reads state — it makes no LLM calls.
    Routing decisions should be deterministic and fast.
    """

    # Check for terminal conditions first
    if state["status"] == "agreed":
        return "agreed"

    if state["status"] == "buyer_walked":
        return "buyer_walked"

    # Check round limit
    if state["round_number"] >= state["max_rounds"]:
        return "deadlocked"

    # Seller rejected the offer outright
    if state["status"] == "rejected":
        return "rejected"

    # Otherwise, continue negotiating
    return "continue"
```

### Complex Multi-Branch Routing

```python
def route_after_buyer(state: NegotiationState) -> str:
    """More complex routing with multiple conditions."""

    # Buyer walked away
    if state["buyer_current_offer"] == 0:
        return "buyer_walked"

    # Buyer accepted seller's last counter
    if (state.get("buyer_accepted_counter")
            and state["buyer_current_offer"] >= state["seller_current_counter"]):
        return "agreed"

    # Buyer went over budget (shouldn't happen, but guard against it)
    if state["buyer_current_offer"] > state["buyer_budget"]:
        return "buyer_walked"

    # Offer crossed seller's minimum — automatic agreement territory
    if state["buyer_current_offer"] >= state["seller_minimum"]:
        return "potential_agreement"

    # Continue normally
    return "continue"

# Register with multiple targets
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "buyer",
    route_after_buyer,
    {
        "continue": "seller",
        "agreed": "finalize",
        "buyer_walked": END,
        "potential_agreement": "fast_accept",  # shortcut node
    }
)
```

### Command Objects (Modern Routing Pattern)

> Source: [LangGraph — Thinking in LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/thinking-in-langgraph)

Modern LangGraph also supports **`Command` objects** — a newer pattern where nodes specify their own destination, rather than relying on external router functions. This makes control flow explicit and traceable inside node logic.

```python
from typing import Literal
from langgraph.types import Command

def classify_buyer_intent(state: NegotiationState) -> Command[Literal["make_offer", "walk_away", "request_info"]]:
    """
    Node that reads buyer intent and routes to the appropriate next node.
    The routing logic lives INSIDE the node — not in a separate router function.
    """
    # ... classify the buyer's intent ...
    if state["buyer_current_offer"] == 0:
        return Command(
            update={"status": "buyer_walked"},
            goto="walk_away"
        )
    elif state["round_number"] == 1:
        return Command(
            update={"status": "negotiating"},
            goto="make_offer"
        )
    else:
        return Command(
            update={"status": "negotiating"},
            goto="make_offer"
        )
```

**When to use `Command` vs `add_conditional_edges`:**

| Approach | Best for |
|---|---|
| `add_conditional_edges` | Routing logic based on state fields; router is reusable across multiple source nodes |
| `Command` object | Routing logic is specific to one node; makes the flow self-documenting |

Both provide the same termination guarantees — the graph still has a terminal `END` node with no outgoing edges.

---

## 6. Shared State Design

Designing state well is the most important architectural decision in a LangGraph workflow.

### State Design Principles

#### 1. Include Only What's Needed

```python
# BAD — too much in state
class BadState(TypedDict):
    full_mls_database: dict           # Don't put large data in state
    raw_llm_responses: list[str]      # Don't store everything
    debug_logs: list[str]             # Use logging instead

# GOOD — focused on what agents need
class GoodState(TypedDict):
    buyer_offer: float                # Specific numeric value
    seller_counter: float             # Specific numeric value
    round_number: int                 # Simple counter
    status: str                       # Finite set of values
    history: Annotated[list, operator.add]  # Accumulated messages
```

#### 2. Use Clear Status Fields

```python
from typing import Literal

# Use Literal for finite state machines
NegotiationStatus = Literal[
    "negotiating",    # Active negotiation in progress
    "agreed",         # Deal reached
    "deadlocked",     # Max rounds with no agreement
    "buyer_walked",   # Buyer withdrew
    "seller_rejected" # Seller rejected all offers
]

class NegotiationState(TypedDict):
    status: NegotiationStatus  # Always know where you are
```

#### 3. Separate Agent Memory from Shared State

```python
class NegotiationState(TypedDict):
    # SHARED — both agents and orchestrator see this
    round_number: int
    buyer_current_offer: float
    seller_current_counter: float
    status: str
    history: Annotated[list, operator.add]

    # PRIVATE — only buyer's LLM conversation context
    buyer_llm_messages: list[dict]

    # PRIVATE — only seller's LLM conversation context
    seller_llm_messages: list[dict]
```

---

## 7. Cycles and Loops

Unlike most workflow tools (which only support DAGs — Directed Acyclic Graphs), LangGraph explicitly supports **cycles**. This is the key feature that enables agent loops.

```
DAG (most workflow tools):        CYCLIC GRAPH (LangGraph):
──────────────────────────        ──────────────────────────────────
START → A → B → C → END          START → BUYER → SELLER → (check)
                                              ↑               │
Only moves forward                            └───────────────┘
                                     Can loop until condition met
```

### How to Create a Loop

```python
workflow = StateGraph(NegotiationState)

workflow.add_node("buyer", buyer_node)
workflow.add_node("seller", seller_node)
workflow.add_node("check_status", check_status_node)

workflow.set_entry_point("buyer")

workflow.add_edge("buyer", "seller")
workflow.add_edge("seller", "check_status")

# THIS CREATES THE LOOP:
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "check_status",
    should_continue_negotiation,
    {
        "continue": "buyer",   # ← loops back to buyer!
        "stop": END
    }
)
```

### Loop Guard — Preventing Infinite Loops

**Always have a termination condition**. In our case, `max_rounds = 5`:

```python
def should_continue_negotiation(state: NegotiationState) -> str:
    # Termination conditions (prevent infinite loops)
    if state["status"] != "negotiating":
        return "stop"

    if state["round_number"] >= state["max_rounds"]:
        return "stop"

    # Check if prices have converged
    gap = state["seller_current_counter"] - state["buyer_current_offer"]
    if gap <= 0:  # offers crossed — deal!
        return "stop"

    return "continue"
```

---

## 8. Persistence and Checkpointing

LangGraph can **save state** between node executions. This enables:
- Resume from where you left off after a crash
- Human-in-the-loop (pause, let a human review, resume)
- Time-travel debugging (replay from any checkpoint)

### Basic Checkpointing

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

# In-memory checkpointer (for development)
checkpointer = MemorySaver()
graph = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# Run with a thread_id (enables resume)
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "negotiation_001"}}
result = graph.invoke(initial_state, config=config)

# Resume from checkpoint
result = graph.invoke(None, config=config)  # None = resume from last checkpoint
```

### Production Checkpointing

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver

# PostgreSQL checkpointer (for production)
checkpointer = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(
    "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/negotiation_db"
)
```

### Human-in-the-Loop

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

checkpointer = MemorySaver()
graph = workflow.compile(
    checkpointer=checkpointer,
    interrupt_before=["seller"]  # Pause BEFORE seller node runs
)

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "review_001"}}

# Run until the interrupt
state = graph.invoke(initial_state, config=config)
# Execution stops before seller_node
# Human can review buyer's offer here...

print(f"Buyer just offered: ${state['buyer_current_offer']:,.0f}")
approval = input("Approve? (y/n): ")

if approval == "y":
    # Resume execution
    final_state = graph.invoke(None, config=config)
```

---

## 9. Error Handling and Retry

### Error Categories — Who Handles What?

> From [LangGraph — Thinking in LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/thinking-in-langgraph):
> Four distinct error types each require a different handling strategy:

| Error Type | Examples | Handler | Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Transient** | Network timeout, rate limit | System | Automatic retry with exponential backoff |
| **LLM-recoverable** | Tool call fails, bad JSON format | LLM | Store error in state, loop back with clearer prompt |
| **User-fixable** | Missing information, ambiguous intent | Human | Pause with `interrupt()`, wait for human input |
| **Unexpected** | Logic bug, assertion failure | Developer | Let it bubble up — don't silently swallow it |

The key insight: **don't retry everything the same way**. A rate limit error needs a different strategy than an LLM giving a malformed response.

In our negotiation simulator, the most common errors are:
- `openai.RateLimitError` → transient, retry with backoff
- `ValueError: bad JSON` → LLM-recoverable, retry with clearer prompt
- `buyer_offer > buyer_budget` → logic bug, let it surface as an error

Also from the docs: *"When combined with other operations in a node, `interrupt()` must come first"* — this prevents partial execution before the human checkpoint.

### Node-Level Error Handling

```python
async def buyer_node(state: NegotiationState) -> dict:
    """Buyer node with retry logic for LLM failures."""

    max_retries = 3
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = await call_openai_with_timeout(
                messages=state["buyer_llm_messages"],
                timeout=30
            )
            return parse_buyer_response(response, state)

        except openai.RateLimitError:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # exponential backoff
                continue
            raise

        except openai.APIError as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                await asyncio.sleep(1)
                continue
            # After max retries, mark negotiation as failed
            return {
                "status": "agent_error",
                "error_message": str(e)
            }

        except ValueError as e:
            # LLM returned malformed response
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                # Try again with a cleaner prompt
                state["buyer_llm_messages"].append({
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "Please respond in valid JSON format only."
                })

            return {"status": "agent_error", "error_message": "Malformed LLM response"}
```

### Graph-Level Error Routing

```python
# Add an error handler node
async def error_handler_node(state: NegotiationState) -> dict:
    """Handles unexpected errors in the negotiation."""
    error = state.get("error_message", "Unknown error")
    print(f"❌ Negotiation failed: {error}")
    return {"status": "error", "agreed_price": None}

workflow.add_node("error_handler", error_handler_node)

# Route to error handler when things go wrong
def route_with_error_handling(state: NegotiationState) -> str:
    if state.get("status") == "agent_error":
        return "error"
    if state.get("round_number", 0) >= state.get("max_rounds", 5):
        return "deadlocked"
    if state.get("status") == "agreed":
        return "agreed"
    return "continue"
```

### When to Choose LangGraph

✅ **Use LangGraph when**:
- Building multi-agent workflows with LLMs
- Need stateful loops that persist across turns
- Want human-in-the-loop capabilities
- Team is already using LangChain ecosystem

❌ **Don't use LangGraph when**:
- Simple single-agent tasks (just call the LLM directly)
- Pure data pipelines (use Prefect or Airflow)
- Non-AI orchestration (use Temporal or Celery)
- Team has no Python experience

---

## 12. Common Misconceptions

### ❌ "LangGraph is for DAGs only"

**Reality**: LangGraph explicitly supports cycles. This is its key differentiator from most workflow tools.

### ❌ "Each node runs its own LLM"

**Reality**: Nodes are just Python functions. They CAN call LLMs, but they can also call APIs, read files, do math — or do nothing. Not every node needs an LLM.

### ❌ "State is like a database"

**Reality**: State is an in-memory dict that lives for the duration of one graph execution. It's not persistent unless you add a checkpointer. Think of it like a function's local variables, not a database.

### ❌ "LangGraph manages the LLM conversation"

**Reality**: LangGraph manages the WORKFLOW state. You still manage LLM conversation history (the messages array) yourself within the state object and within your node functions.

### ❌ "Conditional edges are like if-statements"

**Reality**: Conditional edges are more like router functions in a state machine. They don't execute business logic — they just read state and return a string key indicating the next node. Keep them pure and fast.

## Summary

| Concept | Key Takeaway |
|---|---|
| **Why LangGraph** | Structured state, cycles, persistence, extensibility |
| **State** | TypedDict shared across all nodes; use reducers for accumulation |
| **Nodes** | Python functions that take full state, return partial updates |
| **Edges** | Simple (always) or conditional (route based on state) |
| **Cycles** | The key feature — enables agent loops with termination guards |
| **Checkpointing** | Persist state for resume, human-in-loop, debugging |
| **Error handling** | Retry in nodes, error routing in edges |
| **vs alternatives** | Best for LLM-powered cyclic multi-agent workflows |
